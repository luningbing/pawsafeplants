  **Seek veterinary advice—especially if breathing is affected.**

  1. Gently rinse your cat’s mouth with water.
  2. Offer a small amount of milk, tuna water, or plain yogurt to soothe irritation.
  3. Call your vet or the **ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center** at **(888) 426-4435**.
  4. Monitor for signs of airway obstruction (rare but serious).

  > 💡 Note: Even “chewing and spitting” can cause symptoms—cats don’t need to swallow much.
