  **No action needed—this plant is safe!**

  However:
  - Some cats may vomit if they eat large amounts (due to fiber, not toxicity).
  - Keep soil clean—fertilizers or pesticides could be harmful.
  - Trim brown tips to keep it looking fresh.

  > 💡 Bonus: Spider plants produce “babies” you can propagate—great for gifting!
