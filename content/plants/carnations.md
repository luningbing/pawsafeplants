  **Usually resolves at home—but monitor.**

  1. Wipe your cat’s mouth and paws with a damp cloth.
  2. Offer fresh water.
  3. Call your vet if vomiting persists beyond 4–6 hours.
  4. Great for bouquets—but place out of paw’s reach.

  > 💡 Note: Carnations are common in Mother’s Day arrangements—safe in moderation, but not “cat-proof.”
