summary: "The Swedish Ivy (Plectranthus verticillatus), despite its common name, is not a true ivy but a charming trailing plant celebrated for its vibrant green, scalloped leaves and cascading growth habit. Unlike many common ivies which are toxic, this particular variety is considered non-toxic to both cats and dogs, making it a safe and delightful choice for pet-friendly homes. It thrives beautifully in hanging baskets or perched on shelves, where its lush foliage can gracefully spill downwards, adding a touch of natural elegance to any room. Swedish Ivy is remarkably easy to care for, preferring bright, indirect light and consistent moisture, and it's known for its vigorous growth. Its lush appearance and safe nature make it an ideal plant for adding vibrant greenery without any worries for your curious feline companions."
