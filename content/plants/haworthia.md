summary: "Haworthia (Haworthia spp.) is a captivating genus of succulent plants, often mistaken for Aloe Vera due to their rosette-forming, fleshy leaves, but with the distinct advantage of being completely non-toxic to cats and dogs. This makes them an excellent and worry-free choice for succulent enthusiasts and pet owners alike. Characterized by their striking patterns, such as the white bands on Haworthia fasciata (Zebra Plant), these small, architectural plants add a unique texture and modern touch to any indoor collection. Haworthias are incredibly low-maintenance, thriving in bright, indirect light and requiring minimal watering, making them perfect for busy individuals or those new to plant care who desire a hardy yet stylish botanical companion."
