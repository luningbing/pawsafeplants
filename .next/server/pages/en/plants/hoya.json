{"pageProps":{"plant":{"title":"Hoya","scientific_name":"Hoya spp.","toxicity_level":"Safe","care_difficulty":"Medium","summary":"Hoya (Hoya spp.), often referred to as Wax Plant, is a truly exquisite and sought-after genus of trailing and climbing houseplants, cherished for its thick, waxy leaves and the production of stunning, fragrant, star-shaped flower clusters. Many varieties boast intricate foliage patterns and a glossy texture that adds a touch of sophistication to any indoor space. Fortunately for pet parents, Hoyas are widely considered non-toxic to both cats and dogs, allowing you to enjoy their unique beauty and delightful scent without concern for your furry friends. These plants thrive in bright, indirect light and prefer to dry out between waterings, making them a relatively low-maintenance yet highly rewarding addition. Their charming aesthetic and pet-safe nature make them a perfect choice for hanging baskets or trellises, bringing elegance and a sweet aroma to your home.","image":"/uploads/7ae0aff1-4b60-4c05-aa34-fcd6a9ea3dd2_7930717a90c33c714f1ae8d742554593_ComfyUI_033fc57d_00001_.png","image2":"","image3":"","pet_moment":"","symptoms":[],"common_names":[],"clinical_signs":[],"safe_alternatives":[],"sources":[],"contentHtml":"","what_to_do_html":"","slug":"hoya"}},"__N_SSG":true}
