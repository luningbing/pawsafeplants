{"pageProps":{"plant":{"title":"Zebra Plant","scientific_name":"Aphelandra squarrosa","toxicity_level":"Safe","care_difficulty":"Medium","summary":"The Zebra Plant (Aphelandra squarrosa) is a striking and unique houseplant, instantly recognizable by its dark green leaves boldly striped with contrasting white or yellow veins, creating a dramatic, graphic effect. Despite its common name, it is important to note that the common 'Zebra Plant' often refers to Aphelandra squarrosa, which is generally considered non-toxic to cats and dogs, making it a safe yet vibrant addition for pet-owning households. While it demands slightly more attention than some other houseplants, thriving in high humidity and bright, indirect light, its captivating foliage and ability to produce bright yellow flower bracts make the effort worthwhile. It's a fantastic choice for those looking to add a touch of exotic flair and bold pattern to their indoor garden, with the added benefit of being pet-friendly.","image":"/uploads/7ae0aff1-4b60-4c05-aa34-fcd6a9ea3dd2_7930717a90c33c714f1ae8d742554593_ComfyUI_033fc57d_00001_.png","image2":"","image3":"","pet_moment":"","symptoms":[],"common_names":[],"clinical_signs":[],"safe_alternatives":[],"sources":[],"contentHtml":"","what_to_do_html":"","slug":"zebra-plant"}},"__N_SSG":true}
