{"pageProps":{"plant":{"title":"Calathea","scientific_name":"Calathea spp.","toxicity_level":"Safe","care_difficulty":"Medium","summary":"Calathea (Calathea spp.) is a stunning and highly decorative houseplant genus, famous for its extraordinarily intricate and colorful foliage. Each leaf is a work of art, featuring unique patterns, stripes, and shades of green, purple, and red. These 'prayer plants' also exhibit nyctinasty, meaning their leaves fold up at night and unfurl in the morning, adding a dynamic element to their beauty. Crucially for cat owners, Calatheas are non-toxic to both felines and canines, allowing you to enjoy their luxurious appeal without concern for your pets' safety. While they thrive in high humidity and indirect light, requiring consistent care, the visual reward and pet-friendly nature of Calatheas make them a prized addition for those seeking to elevate their interior decor with a touch of living artistry.","image":"/uploads/7ae0aff1-4b60-4c05-aa34-fcd6a9ea3dd2_7930717a90c33c714f1ae8d742554593_ComfyUI_033fc57d_00001_.png","image2":"","image3":"","pet_moment":"","symptoms":[],"common_names":[],"clinical_signs":[],"safe_alternatives":[],"sources":[],"contentHtml":"","what_to_do_html":"","slug":"calathea"}},"__N_SSG":true}
