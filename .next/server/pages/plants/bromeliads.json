{"pageProps":{"plant":{"title":"Bromeliads","scientific_name":"Bromeliaceae family","toxicity_level":"Safe","care_difficulty":"Easy","summary":"Bromeliads (Bromeliaceae family) are exotic and vibrant tropical plants that bring an instant splash of color and a festive, resort-like atmosphere to any indoor space. Characterized by their striking, often long-lasting flower bracts (which are often more colorful than the actual flowers) and rosette-forming foliage, they are a fantastic way to introduce bold design elements into your home decor. Critically for pet owners, Bromeliads are non-toxic to both cats and dogs, offering a worry-free way to enjoy their captivating beauty. These resilient plants are relatively easy to care for, thriving in bright, indirect light and requiring water mainly in their central 'cup' rather than in the soil. Their unique charm and pet-friendly status make them an excellent choice for adding a touch of the tropics and a pop of cheer to your living environment.","image":"/uploads/7ae0aff1-4b60-4c05-aa34-fcd6a9ea3dd2_7930717a90c33c714f1ae8d742554593_ComfyUI_033fc57d_00001_.png","image2":"","image3":"","pet_moment":"","symptoms":[],"common_names":[],"clinical_signs":[],"safe_alternatives":[],"sources":[],"contentHtml":"","what_to_do_html":"","slug":"bromeliads"}},"__N_SSG":true}
